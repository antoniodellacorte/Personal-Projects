# Bank Churn Prediction Project in R

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques implemented in R. Customer churn is a critical metric for banks, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of various machine learning models to predict churn and provide actionable insights.

## Project Structure
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loaded the dataset and performed data cleaning, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of features and identify key patterns and correlations related to customer churn.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created and selected features that improve the predictive power of the model.
- **Modeling:** Applied machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict churn. The models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation techniques.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to determine the best-performing model.
- **Results:** The final model provides accurate predictions of customer churn, allowing the bank to identify high-risk customers and implement retention strategies.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Manipulation in R:** Utilized R libraries such as `dplyr` and `tidyr` for data wrangling and preprocessing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Used `ggplot2` for visualizations to explore relationships between features and churn.
- **Machine Learning in R:** Applied models using `caret`, `randomForest`, and `e1071` packages for training and evaluation.
- **Model Optimization:** Tuned model parameters and selected the best model based on performance metrics.
