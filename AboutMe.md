## 👋 Hi, I’m @antoniodellacorte

- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of data science, finance, and energy solutions. My passion lies in leveraging data to drive insights and innovation in these fields, particularly through the application of machine learning and predictive analytics.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Python programming, data science libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn, and diving deeper into machine learning techniques. I'm also exploring how these skills can be applied to real-world challenges in finance and the energy sector.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve financial data analysis, energy consumption modeling, and any initiative that aims to make a positive impact through data-driven decision-making. If you're working on something exciting in these areas, let's connect!
